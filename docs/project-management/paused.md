## 📋 Currently Paused Tasks

### Task: Architecture Diagrams Creation
- **Epic:** Foundation & Architecture
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Estimated:** 3 hours
- **Paused Date:** 2024-09-23
- **Reason:** Waiting for backend core implementation to finalize
- **Dependencies:** Backend core engine completion

**Description:** Create visual architecture diagrams for system overview

**Planned Work:**
- System architecture diagram
- Browser pool lifecycle diagram
- Data flow diagrams
- Component interaction diagrams

**Resume Conditions:**
- Backend core engine implementation started
- Architecture patterns validated in code
- Component boundaries clearly defined

**Impact of Delay:** Low - can be completed later without affecting development

### Task: Database Schema Finalization
- **Epic:** Foundation & Architecture
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Estimated:** 2 hours
- **Paused Date:** 2024-09-23
- **Reason:** Current schema sufficient for MVP, optimization can wait
- **Dependencies:** Real usage patterns from MVP

**Description:** Optimize database schema based on usage patterns

**Planned Work:**
- Index optimization
- Query performance analysis
- Data retention policies
- Backup strategies refinement

**Resume Conditions:**
- MVP deployed and collecting real data
- Performance bottlenecks identified
- Scaling requirements clearer

**Impact of Delay:** Minimal - current schema handles MVP requirements

## 📊 Pause Analysis

### Pause Reasons Distribution
- **Waiting for dependencies:** 1 task
- **Deferred optimization:** 1 task

### Estimated Time on Hold
- **Architecture Diagrams:** Will resume in 1-2 weeks
- **Database Schema:** Will resume in 4-6 weeks

## 🔄 Review Schedule

### Weekly Review Questions
1. Are pause conditions still valid?
2. Have dependencies been resolved?
3. Has priority changed due to new requirements?
4. Can tasks be broken down differently to unblock?

## 📈 Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts of Pausing
- **Focus maintained** on critical path items
- **Resources not wasted** on premature optimization
- **Dependencies properly managed**

### Monitoring for Negative Impacts
- **Architecture debt:** Monitor if lack of diagrams causes confusion
- **Performance issues:** Watch for database bottlenecks in MVP

---

## 🚀 Resume Criteria

### Architecture Diagrams
**Resume When:**
- Backend core engine has clear component boundaries
- At least 3 major components implemented
- Architecture patterns validated in practice

**Success Metrics:**
- Diagrams accurately reflect implemented system
- Team uses diagrams for onboarding/planning
- Architecture decisions documented visually

### Database Schema Finalization
**Resume When:**
- MVP handling 100+ concurrent users
- Query performance metrics available
- Scaling bottlenecks identified

**Success Metrics:**
- Query performance improved by 50%+
- Database can handle 10x current load
- Backup/recovery procedures tested
